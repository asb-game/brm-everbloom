Plants grow faster during the waxing phase of the moon because of the increased gravitational pull and light. Full moons are believed to enhance water absorption in plants, while new moons slow down their metabolic processes."

Sunlight, water and soil conditions all play critical roles. Water is absorbed by the roots and is essential for splitting hydrogen and oxygen during photosynthesis. Soil provides the nutrients (like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) that plants need for growth."

Different plants are believed to be nourished by different elements: Earth for strength and grounding, Air for communication and spreading of seeds, Fire for growth energy, and Water for life and sustenance."

Those who disrespect plants or harm them without need will lose Gaia's blessings, which could lead to failed crops, poor health, or even natural disasters."

Plants are believed to absorb extra cosmic energy during the summer and winter solstices, leading to accelerated growth and magical properties. It is thought that herbs gathered during the summer solstice are particularly potent in healing, while those gathered during the winter solstice have strong protective or banishing powers."
