 Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to convert water, carbon dioxide,

1
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.240
 and minerals from the ground to create oxygen and energy-rich glucose.

2
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.000
 Some light, water, and soil conditions all play critical roles.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.560
 Water is absorbed by the roots and is essential for splitting hydrogen and oxygen during photosynthesis.

4
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.680
 Soil provides the nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that plants need for growth.

5
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.360
 This whole process sounds really complicated.

6
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.040
 You're talking about sunlight, water, and soil.

7
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.440
 How are we supposed to figure out what actually matters here?

8
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.160
 That's right. It's all too much.

9
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.480
 Are these even real things? How does any of this help us fix the crops?

10
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.560
 This isn't practical.

11
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.920
 Exactly.

12
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.920
 The fields used to grow fine without all this confusing science.
