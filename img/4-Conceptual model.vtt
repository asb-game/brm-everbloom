00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 Well, that didn't go quite as we hoped.

1
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.280
 They really got caught up in the details

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.480
 and lost sight of the bigger issue.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.040
 And it wasn't even that your explanation was wrong.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.080
 All those extra details made them miss

5
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.640
 what's really going on.

6
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.880
 Exactly.

7
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.920
 I tried to explain how photosynthesis works,

8
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.000
 but it seemed like they missed the whole point.

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.720
 Even if the soil and water were perfect,

10
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.400
 the huge castle is blocking the sunlight.

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.480
 How about we create a conceptual diagram

12
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.400
 that highlights the main problem?

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.360
 The castle is blocking the sunlight.

14
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.000
 At the same time we can still acknowledge

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.759
 the importance of water and soil.
