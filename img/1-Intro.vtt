 Our researchers finally paid off. We've opened the wormhole, but we still don't quite know where or when we've landed.

1
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 This place feels familiar, but it's from another time, a land of superstition in ancient ways.

2
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 The people here are poor and hungry.

3
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Soon after we arrived, some guards found us. Thankfully we convinced them of our mission.

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 We're from the future here to help save their crops.

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Now we've been summoned by the king. Tomorrow we'll meet him to see what we can do to help.

6
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Welcome to Everblum. Take a look at my fields. Half of the crops are flourishing but the other half. They're withering away.

7
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 This is the first harvest of our prize Sunblum grain, a special hearty crop that we've poured a great deal of gold into.

8
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 And we were so careful in choosing this plot. The soil is even and the rains have been plentiful. Everything should be perfect.

9
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 But look at the shadow cast over the dying crops. The small folks say it's just the castle, but the mage's whisper it's a bad omen.

10
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 I don't know what to believe, but I can't ignore what's happening. If we lose this harvest we risk more than just gold. We risk the future of this kingdom.
